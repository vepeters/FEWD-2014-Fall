Why I'm here

I'm here because I am a graphic designer and in order for me to further my career, it feels necessary to learn front end web development.

I'm incredibly interested in responsive design such as parralax or whatever may be 2014/2015's new web trend. I'm also interested in simple custom designs for wordpress so that I can leave the copy editing up to my clients (it seems to be in high demand)

Also... I told my friend over a year ago that I'd build him a website in exchange for him getting me into a ton of useful meetups and networking nights (whoops!)
